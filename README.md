# Cosmo
## Made by: BTDlegand101

Cosmo is a console machine that allows you to perform
multiple actions such as computing simple math problems
or saving values in registers. More features will be
implemented, and I would love to get feedback and/or
suggestions about what I could add next.

To use this code, download the files and run Main.py
